        <p class="mb-4">
          I know from my own life that managing a child’s school schedule is a lot of work.
          I’ve partnered with my wife who homeschools our children to develop this application.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          School Desk is the system that we use to keep our school life sane.
          I’m glad I can share it, and I hope the app can bring some sanity to you as well.
