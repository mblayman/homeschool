School breaks can now be set
for individual students
in a school!
This is a change from the classic handling
of school breaks
that applied school breaks
to all students unconditionally.

<!--more-->

When our family takes breaks
from school,
we usually have both of our kids
on break.
This makes perfect sense
for breaks like Christmas vacation,
but having everyone on break
at the same time
isn't always what we want.

Sometimes my kids have different schedules
and activities.
With the older version of School Desk,
we had no choice but to treat a school break
as all or nothing for the school.
I'd imagine this would be even harder
for families with many children beyond my two,
especially if there is a large age spread.

Now,
on the school break form,
you'll find the ability to select which students will be on break.
This is perfect
for when you have conflicting schedules
and want to see an accurate view
of your school week
in School Desk.

By default,
School Desk will assume
that all students should be on break,
but if you want to make a break more specific,
you can uncheck a student
that should still have school
on a particular day.

I'm still working every week to make School Desk a better tool
for my family and yours.
If you've got other ideas
or feedback,
don't hestitate to reach out!
