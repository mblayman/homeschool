When building a course,
you can create many tasks at once
with School Desk's bulk creation tools.
What do you do when you make a mistake
and create tasks
that you don't want?

<!--more-->

You can now delete many tasks
from a single page
instead of delete one at a time.
This should save you some clicks
and time
if you happen to goof
as you build your course.

You can find this new feature
as one of the action buttons
on your course page.
On the delete page,
you'll see all the tasks
in your course.
You can select multiple tasks,
click "Delete,"
confirm your deletion,
and the goof is gone! ðŸ˜„

I want to say thanks to Eve
for the suggestion!
If any of you have feature suggestions,
please don't hesitate to reach out
with the suggestion
to School Desk's support email address.
