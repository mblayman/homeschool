Courses
=======

The School Desk :term:`Course` is your tool
for grouping tasks
for a school subject
in a :term:`Grade Level`.

A Course can be created from scratch.
From the "Add Course" page,
you can set the days the course runs on,
default task duration,
and other attributes.
After creating the course,
you add tasks with the task creation tools.

Alternatively,
you can use the course copying feature
by selecting "Copy Course"
on "Add Course" page.
Using this feature,
you can create a new course
that includes all the :term:`Task` and :term:`Resource` items
from the previous course.

Tasks
-----

A Course is made up
of many tasks.
You can create tasks individually
or use tools to create many tasks
at once.
If you make a mistake
when creating many tasks,
School Desk also includes tools
to delete tasks
in bulk.
